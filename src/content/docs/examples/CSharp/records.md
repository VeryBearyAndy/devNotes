# Records
+ it allows for direct comparsion of properties, since a comparison of classes compare the objects
    + this is because classes are reference values
    + records circumvent this, and allow for direct comparison without needing to reference it
+ records are immutable and do not allow updates, so they are perfect for read only situations
