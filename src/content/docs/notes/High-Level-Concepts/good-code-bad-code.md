## Qualities of Good Code

Qualities:
+ good code passes the tests
    + It does what its supposed to do
    + Its easy to change

## Continuous Integration

Changes in the software development lifecycle have produced an atmosphere that promotes frequent pushes to deployment rather than a towering level of changes that hits deployment
this changes the development strategy as large releases need to by engineering in such a way that need to be thoroughly designed, which can lead to overly complex solutions
frequent releases engender simple solutions, and simple solutions that are not good coding solutions simply get refactored. 

## Qualities of Bad Code 
+ Code Smells
    + Hints of bad designs that hint when refactoring could improve the overall design of a piece of code
    + These tend to happen over time, they often are not immediately obviously
